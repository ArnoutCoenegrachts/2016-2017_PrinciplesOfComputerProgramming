# PrinciplesOfComputerProgramming_16-17
This repository contains the code associated with the practica of the Bachelor course Principles of Computer Programming at the KU Leuven, that was followed in the academic year 2016-2017. 

This course was given in Dutch, so much of the code is written in it as well.

In the first practicum, we had to program a displayable clock.
In the second practicum, we had to write a program that could solve a any given maze, with the shortest possible route. 
Prior to the oral defense of the second practicum, we were given a couple of hours to implement some additional things in our maze-solver. This is the file with "EXPANSION" in its name.
